This project helped me to learn a lot about python libraries including Numpy , Pandas , and matplotlib which are used a lot in todays world for data analysis and machine learning. 
this project does not include backend connection to store user detail permanently in database rather it store data temporarily in memory till the program is running. 

We can further upgade this program by integrating a user friendly interface and connecting to a database.
